# Encoding-project-2

**Project Objective**
This project follows on from the encoding approach presented in the XML-TEI course. The goal this time is to apply the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) to our own projects, while also being able to customize document encoding to address our research questions. 
To achieve this, we encode three poems by *Victor Hugo*, *Charles Baudelaire*, and *Paul Verlaine*, drawing on both lessons taught at school and the **TEI guidelines**.
