# Encoding-project-2

***Project Objective***

This project follows on from the encoding approach presented in the XML-TEI course. The goal this time is to apply the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) to our own projects, while also being able to customize document encoding to address our research questions. 
Drawing on both lessons taught at school and the **TEI guidelines**. Our work therefore includes: README, three TEI XML files encoded according to the **TEI_all format** and a comparative analysis with the DTD designed during Assignment 1.

***Sources***
To achieve this, we encode three poems by *Victor Hugo*, *Charles Baudelaire*, and *Paul Verlaine*, selected from digital reproductions available on Gallica (Bibliothèque nationale de France). Each file is structured according to the basic TEI schema (for texts in reverse), comprising a <teiHeader> up to the <text>. We therefore have the title, author, source, ARK identifier, language, date and description.
